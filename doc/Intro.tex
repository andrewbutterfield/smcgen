\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

This document is a record of the development of a process
to specify probabilistic models at a high level of abstraction.
It started with a concrete Prism model of Flash Memory (\S\ref{sec:FlashPM}),
where one parameter (\prsm{b})
had to be fixed (\prsm{b=3}).
because of the limitations of the Prism language.

The process involves successive levels of abstraction:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Hacking the prism model to work with \prsm{b >=  2}
    (\S\ref{sec:lhs:Hack}).
  \item
    First level of abstraction:
    identifying the necessary language support for arrays
    (\S\ref{sec:lhs:Abs1}).
\end{itemize}
